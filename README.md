# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my personal GitHub, where I keep all my system configurations, helper functions, and scripts. 
I'm currently a Senior Mechanical Engineer at a mine site in Queensland, Australia. 
Although my formal training is in mechanical engineering, math and finance, I have a passion for programming & data science (hence the contents of my GitHub).

Please feel free to use my scripts and code however you see fit; I'm a big believer in open source and use other people's work on GitHub as inspiration for my own. So, if you see it and like it, you can have it. *(disclaimer: I take no responsibility for what you do with it or if it breaks something)*

My current projects are split between engineering, finance and data science and primarily exist to make my life easier at home and work.
